  This procedure read the JCPDS file.  There are several versions of the
       formats used for JCPDS files.  Versions 1, 2 and 3 used a fixed
       format, where a particular entry had to be in a specific location on
       a specific line.  Versions 2 and 3 were used only by Dan Shim.
       This routine can read these old files, but no new files should be
       created in this format, they should be converted to Version 4.
       Version 4 is a "keyword" driven format.  Each line in the file is of
       the form:
       KEYWORD: value
       The order of the lines is not important, except that the first line of
       the file must be "VERSION: 4".
       The following keywords are currently supported:
           COMMENT:    Any information describing the material, literature
                       references, etc.  There can be multiple comment lines
                       per file.
           K0:         The bulk modulus in GPa.
           K0P:        The change in K0 with pressure, for Birch-Murnaghan
                       equation of state.  Dimensionless.
           DK0DT:      The temperature derivative of K0, GPa/K.
           DK0PDT:     The temperature derivative of K0P, 1/K.
           SYMMETRY:   One of CUBIC, TETRAGONAL, HEXAGONAL, RHOMBOHEDRAL,
                       ORTHORHOMBIC, MONOCLINIC or TRICLINIC
           A:          The unit cell dimension A
           B:          The unit cell dimension B
           C:          The unit cell dimension C
           ALPHA:      The unit cell angle ALPHA
           BETA:       The unit cell angle BETA
           GAMMA:      The unit cell angle GAMMA
           VOLUME:     The unit cell volume
           ALPHAT:     The thermal expansion coefficient, 1/K
           DALPHADT:   The temperature derivative of the thermal expansion
                       coefficient, 1/K^2
           DIHKL:      For each reflection, the D spacing in Angstrom, the
                       relative intensity (0-100), and the H, K, L indices.

       This procedure calculates the D spacing of each relfection, using the
       symmetry and unit cell parameters from the file.  It compares the
       calculated D spacing with the input D spacing for each line.  If they
       disagree by more than 0.1% then a warning message is printed.
       The following is an example JCPDS file in the Version 4 format:
